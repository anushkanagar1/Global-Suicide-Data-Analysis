# 🌍 Global Suicide Rate Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **global suicide rates across countries and age groups** to uncover trends, patterns, and potential insights.  
The dataset contains demographic details such as **country, year, gender, and age groups**, which are used to explore correlations with suicide rates over time.  

The goal is to practice **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization** skills while drawing meaningful conclusions from real-world data.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze suicide rate trends across **years and countries**.
- Compare suicide rates based on **gender and age groups**.
- Identify countries with the **highest and lowest suicide rates**.
- Explore socio-economic factors (e.g., GDP per capita) linked with suicide rates.
- Visualize the findings using **charts and dashboards**.
-
